Recently my friend introduced me to [Waifu2x](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x) which is an image scaling and noise reduction program for the anime art style. After being specifically told by a friend not to use Waifu2x on pixel art I decided I knew exactly what I wanted to do, upscale the entire Minecraft texture pack. Default Minecraft textures are 16x16 pixels, I decided to upscale them by four times to 64x64.

This lead to some very interesting and weird results with the textures no longer tiling correctly. The textures also just had a lot of "creases" with sharp black squiggly lines going through the texture. Below are some reference images for how it looks. For those crazy enough to want to download this texture pack click [here](/resources/WaifuCraft/WaifuCraft.zip) to download it.
